## Simulate systematic sampling over GFC

The goal of that program is to determine empirically which sampling intensity is needed with a systematic sampling design (SSD) to detect tree cover loss as defined in the GFC product (Hansen et al. 2013, Science).

It generates a dense grid over the AOI, downloads the corresponding GFC data, subsets the grid at regular intervals and simulates what the SSD would give as a result.

The user can modify the country, the densest intensity and the GFC thresholds.

By default, TC is set at 30% and densest grid is 1km wide
